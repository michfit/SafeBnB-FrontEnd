        "Neighborhood Overview": "We think this is the best neighbourhood in Toronto. It has a mix of families, students, couples and long-time residents and a diversity of shops and activities that cater to everyone. And because it's right on the Bloor subway you can explore the whole city without a car.  Our local park, Christie Pits, is 5 minutes away. It has an outdoor pool - with slide - and summer festivals almost every weekend.  The Dufferin Grove farmers' market on Thursday and the Wychwood Barns Saturday market are also nearby. Bloor Street, 5 minutes south, has multiple coffee bars, restaurants, pubs, a bookshoop, record stores and more. Dovercourt Village is two blocks away  and has a new gourmet pizzeria, a great local coffee and brunch restaurant, flowers and now, a hairdresser. If you are taking a summer course at U of T, you can easily bike there along dedicated bike paths the whole way.",

There are million dollar condos near by inexpensive student digs supporting both Ryerson and George Brown College.

With such a short walk to all the city has to offer, it's no surprise that this area is rapidly changing and the population is growing. It's a fantastic place to be!  As with any large city, you will encounter homeless people in the downtown core. Generally they are harmless, but be aware. If you are not comfortable with this, you might want to consider a location further from downtown.",

You are as close to\/far from downtown as you are from Newmarket or Mississauga. Depending on your needs, you can access pretty much any area of the place.

Pretty safe, nothing fancy, divided between apartments and houses.  It is suburbia but there are plenty of lovely restaurants around. I recommend East Side Marios at Dufferin and Steeles, Mr. Greek at Dufferin and Finch, and several places on Yonge Street, the main drag, especially between Finch and Sheppard. If you don't mind walking, Mel Lastman Square is about 5_ km away and often features musical acts and other live entertainment and street festivals. In the square and around is a subway station and one of the city's biggest libraries.",

It is close to lots of great restaurants, pubs, shops, movie theatres and Lake Ontario.  The beach has 3 km of white sand, great sunsets, swimming, boardwalk and a great bicycle path that easily takes you downtown. Uber can usually get you right downtown for around $20.00. There is an open air park and concert venue nearby (Woodbine Park) which has an event every weekend, it seems. Woofstock, Craft shows, Ribfests, concerts, to name a few. Mid July (July 21- 23rd) the main street of the Beaches is shut down for the annual Beaches Jazz festival.",

Please be assured that Toronto is by far the safest metropolitan city in North America, and we encourage all our guests to explore the city by foot, as it is meant to be discovered. Be at the centre of all the action and walking distance from fantastic restaurants, cafes, shops, cinemas, liquor stores, bars, patios and everything else at your doorstep.  There is one of the largest supermarkets in the city just a couple blocks away, and we are a short walk from one of the largest parks in the city, complete with swimming pool, tennis courts, skating rink, hiking trails and an awesome tobogganing hill. We are happy to share some of our favourite places with you. Biking trails in the Don Valley are 10 minutes away and a great way to get some exercise car-free! Many bike lanes in the cit",
